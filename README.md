# üë®‚Äçüî¨ Vue Lab

Vue Lab is collection of detailed Vue.js **components** and **directives** that can easily be reused into your Vue.js projects. Such Vue.js goodies are useful when pulling an existing library seems like an overkill and you just need a place to start, something to **copy/paste/edit** into your projects.

## Components

* **[Delete](components/delete)**. Confirm deletion without openning a modal.
* **[EditableTextarea](components/editable-textarea)**. Edit the selected text of a textarea. *(renderless)*
* **[InputFile](components/input-file)**. Display a decent input file to your users.
* **[ResizableTextarea](components/resizable-textarea)**. Resize a textarea based on its content. *(renderless)*

## Directives

* **[Dragdrop](directives/dragdrop)**. Reorder your lists using drag&drop.

## Contributing

You are more than welcome to request or suggest more Vue.js goodies by either openning an issue or implementing it yourself in a PR. When openning a PR, please provide a `readme.md` file following the same convention as the ones provided with existing goodies. A working example on CodePen and/or a blog article is also more than welcome.
